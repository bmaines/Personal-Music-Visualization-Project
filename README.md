1. About: 
This project is designed to grab and download playlist information from Spotify. I started this project to get an understanding of data storage, data cleaning, data visualization, Python and more I wanted to further my Data Analyst career by working on SQL, Python, and PowerBI.

2. Requirements: 
Spotify: You'll need a Spotify account, a playlist, and access to your personal Web API (client_id, client_secret, and redirect_url). If you don't have those, go here: https://developer.spotify.com/. If you don't have a playlist on Spotify but have one for another streaming service, I would recommend using https://www.tunemymusic.com/ to transfer your playlists to Spotify (for example, I primarily use Youtube Music. They do not have a public Web API, so I transferred to Spotify).

Python: Have Python installed and usable on your favorite IDE.

3. Optional - Cleaning and Data Storage: 
You can use any data storage/cleaning software you want. I used SQL Server and Excel, as the software is easily transferable to PowerBI.

4. Optional - Data Visualization Software: 
You can use any data storage/cleaning software you want. I used PowerBI. You can download PowerBI Desktop for free here: https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/
